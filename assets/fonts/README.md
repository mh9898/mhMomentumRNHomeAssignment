# Gothic A1 Font Setup

To use the Gothic A1 font in this app, you need to download the font files and place them in this directory.

## Steps:

1. **Download Gothic A1 font files** from Google Fonts:
   - Visit: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Gothic+A1
   - Click "Download family"
   - Extract the ZIP file

2. **Copy the following font files** to this directory (`assets/fonts/`):
   - `GothicA1-Regular.ttf`
   - `GothicA1-Medium.ttf`
   - `GothicA1-SemiBold.ttf`
   - `GothicA1-Bold.ttf`

3. **Alternative: Download individual weights**:
   - Regular: https://fonts.google.com/download?family=Gothic%20A1
   - Or use the direct download link from Google Fonts

## Font Usage:

The font is now available in your theme as:
- `Fonts.gothicA1` - Regular weight
- `Fonts.gothicA1Medium` - Medium weight
- `Fonts.gothicA1SemiBold` - SemiBold weight
- `Fonts.gothicA1Bold` - Bold weight

Example usage:
```tsx
fontFamily: Fonts.gothicA1SemiBold
```

## Note:

The font files are not included in the repository. You must download them manually and place them in this directory before running the app.
